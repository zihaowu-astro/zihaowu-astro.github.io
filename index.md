<h1>About Me</h1>

I am Zihao Wu, a PhD student at [Department of Astronomy, Harvard University](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/). I primarily work with Professor [Daniel J. Eisenstein](https://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein/). I am a member of the [JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES)](https://jades-survey.github.io/). My research focuses on the galaxies and large-scale structures at Cosmic Dawn.

I received my undergraduate degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn), advised by [Luis C. Ho](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~lho/).  Outside of research, I enjoy long-distance cycling and hiking. I have biked over 2,000 km, including a 900 km journey over three weeks. I also enjoy playing guitar, hiking, and reading.
