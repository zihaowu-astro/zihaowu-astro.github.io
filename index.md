<h1>About Me</h1>

I am Zihao Wu, a PhD student at [Department of Astronomy, Harvard University](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by Professor [Daniel J. Eisenstein](https://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein/). I am a member of the [JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES)](https://jades-survey.github.io/). I received my undergraduate degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn), where I was advised by [Luis C. Ho](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~lho/).  

My research focuses on JWST observations of galaxies within the first 500 Myr after the Big Bang. I am interested in the "overluminous" problem, where galaxies at $z>10$ appear much more luminous than expected from lower-redshift trends and cosmological simulations.  To address this, I use ultra-deep JWST imaging and spectroscopy to study their physical properties. I also study proto-clusters and overdensities, which are expected to host the most massive galaxies at early times. I have contributed to the JADES data reduction pipeline, including sky-flat construction and the removal of scattered-light artifacts.

Outside of research, I enjoy long-distance cycling, hiking, playing guitar, and reading. I have biked over 2,000 km, including a 900 km journey across the Yunnan Plateau, serving as the rear support rider handling mechanical repairs.
